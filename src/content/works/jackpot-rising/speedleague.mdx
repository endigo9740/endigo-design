Speedleague is an international motorsports league created by Red Bullâ€™s Global Rallycross Championship creator Brian Gale. Building on the League's role as a sports organizer for X-Games motorsports and partnered with ESPN, Jackpot Rising took on the challenge of developing a mobile racing video game to help promote and run tournaments alongside each real world race, which would be held at locations such as The Bahamas, St. Petersburg, Dubai, and more. I designed the UX, implemented the UI, and provided minor contributions to the game development. The game was originally started in Unity, but later ported to the Unreal engine.
