One of the key efforts at Jackpot Rising included integrating our tournament platform with physical game cabinets, including skeeball, basketball, and mini-golf. I designed and implemented the on-screen UI and connection mechanisms, powered by Android Things running on a Raspberry Pi. Players could walk up to the device, sign into a web-based client, scan a QR code, and then immediately start playing the game. The web client featured a WebGL-based camera and utilized websockets to sync to the device. These arcade devices were featured at Dreamhack Dallas 2019 and the Dallas Cattle Baronâ€™s Ball.
