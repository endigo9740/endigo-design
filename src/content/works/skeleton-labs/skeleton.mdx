I am the creator and core maintainer for [Skeleton](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton) - an open source and framework agnostic design system and component library for web-based frameworks such as Svelte and React. Skeleton integrates with Tailwind to provide an opinionated solution for generating adaptive design systems. Including easy to use components for your favorite web frameworks. Skeleton provides a uniform design language and structured framework for controlling the look and feel of your product and user experience. It serves as an opinionated design system that aims to greatly reduce the amount of time spent managing design elements and patterns, allowing you to more quickly build and manage your frontend interfaces at scale.
