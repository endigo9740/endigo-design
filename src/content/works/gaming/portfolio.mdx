In my previous iteration of this portfolio website, I introduced a game-like experience. The aesthetic was heavily inspired by video games such as Heart Machine's [Hyper Light Drifter](https://www.heartmachine.com/hyper-light-drifter). This project paired SvelteKit, Tailwind, and [Skeleton](/works/skeleton-labs/skeleton). It made heavy use of [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) to handle the visual and interactive aspects of Canvas and WebGL. Each pixel and sprite was hand drawn using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), and the overworld generated using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). You could optionally enable music, which used a sound system powered by [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/). I covered the creation of the site [in this blog post](https://dev.to/endigo9740/my-new-portfolio-3ke6), and you may [find the source code here](https://github.com/endigo9740/endigo-design/tree/v1).
