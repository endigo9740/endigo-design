The customer-facing frontend web application for the Brain & Bones platform, the Helm allows B2B clients to manage games, tournaments, and monitor game usage and engagement within their organization. I directed all key initiatives of the project from concept to launch. This included designing and implementing the frontend client, collaborating with our backend developer. I aided in implemented Stripe as our payment gateway, and fielded quality assurance testing alongside our QA engineer.
