Over the course of two years, I served as VP of Engineering, where I maintained all design efforts for Brain & Bones. I also managing an extremely talented team of developers. Our task was overseeing the core SaaS platform, managing the user-facing web apps, including the Speed Trivia game client. I developed all branding and design guidelines, which includes the UX and visual identity for each unique product.
