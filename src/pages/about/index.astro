            <p>Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>
              Welcome to my humble showcase, featuring a few of my most
              prominent works. I have dedicated the last 20+ years of my life to
              building a career in professional development, design, and UX. I
              am primarily self taught in these disciplines, but still take time
              to research, tinker, and learn more every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              I discovered my passion for programming and design while attending
              classes for Visual Basic and Photoshop in high school. I'm also a
              lifelong fan of video games, which all began when I received my
              first console as a kid, a classic Nintendo Entertainment System. I
              still remember the magic of picking up that controller and making
              Mario run and jump on the screen - though occasionally to his
              untimely death.
            </p>
            <p>
              My passion has fueled a lifelong journey, culminating in a career
              path that includes a broad spectrum of industries, including:
              photography, corporate media, a digital agency, as well as a
              number of tech startups - all before landing in my current role as
              the core maintainer for <a

                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer">Skeleton</a
              >, a web-based UI toolkit. Over the years, I've had the privilage
              of working alongside some of the most talented and passionate
              individuals I know, while building platforms for the web, gaming,
              and open source.
            </p>
            <p>
              I feel my strength lies not just in writing code or designing
              interfaces, but in solving real world problems. I pride myself in
              my ability to listen, learn, and help determine what is really
              needed for any and all challenges. Providing solutions at every
              step of the process, from concept to execution. Whether youâ€™re
              trying to build a web application, engage your audience, or carve
              a new path in the world. My skills are available to help get you
              to where you need to be!
