I am the creator and core maintainer for [Skeleton](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton) - an open source UI toolkit for web-based frameworks such as Svelte and React.

The library provides an array of atomic CSS elements, feature-rich components, and flexible utility features. Pairing Tailwind's utility classes with dedicated component packages, Skeleton can created customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces for any web-based project.

Skeleton has been very well received, with over 80k+ downloads a month, 4k+ stars on GitHub, over 100+ contributors, and 3k+ members on the community Discord. We expect to see a much larger amount of growth in the near future with the addition of [React support in version 3.0](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/skeleton/discussions/2375).

To help promote Skeleton, I've made appearances at [Svelte Summit 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxK9iA1ktlU), [Svelte Sirens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OnJYCXJPK4), the [Logrocket Podcast](https://podrocket.logrocket.com/skeleton?ref=skeleton.ghost.io), as well as our [Skeleton v1 Launch Livestream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJtgPDPrJYAuDISpNrarLCjVInKknDCcA). Skeleton has been covered by popular content creators, such as [Geoff Rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaF8kRbHbi0), [Huntabyte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_A0qQ7AuK8), and [Joy of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0mNU0maItY). It has also garnered recognition from [Rich Harris](https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1654883813078474755), the creator of Svelte and SvelteKit.
