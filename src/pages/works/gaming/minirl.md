Minirl was my first foray into indie game development. In the game you play as Hank, the adorably murderous square boy, as he traverses a variety of worlds full of creepy monsters and overcomes dangerous obstacles in search for Minirls - powerful gems that grant power.

Minirl is a procedurally-generated 2D rogue-lite with puzzle elements, which means a unique experience each time you play. It features accessible gameplay which allows you to dive right into the fun!

Music and sound effects were composed by Jesse W.D. James and mixed by Paul Lipscomb, whose work has been featured in games such as Destiny 2.
