I’m a long time fan of FromSoft games (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, etc). One of their newest entries, [Elden Ring](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring), is a sprawling action RPG that’s found massive success since release. I created this simple open source web application which allows players to visually browse and plan their character’s armor, armaments, and more. My [Twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/endigodesign/status/1537950064215089153) garnered the attention of several prominent members of the FromSoft community members on launch. This was created using an early iteration of my Skeleton UI toolkit.
