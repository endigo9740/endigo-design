Jackpot Rising was a tournament platform that integrated within games of all types, including hardcore, casual/mobile, and even real world arcade devices. The platform allowed users to compete against one another in progressive eSports-esque tournaments for real money, prizes, and digital goods. During my three years at Jackpot Rising, I managed the majority of the company’s branding, UX, product design, and led several key projects and initiatives.
