Homebase was the customer-facing app for the Jackpot Rising platform and primary means for managing tournaments, leaderboards, prize fulfillment, user moderation, and much more. A web-based PWA, it featured a full role and permission system for large corporations. I was the project lead on this product and led all design and implementation.
