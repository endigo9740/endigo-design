The customer-facing web application for the Brain & Bones platform, the Helm allows clients to manage games, tournaments, and monitor game usage and engagement within their organization. I directed all key initiatives of the project from concept to launch. This included designing and implementing the frontend client, providing requirements for backend developers, implementing Stripe as the payment gateway, and fielding quality assurance testing alongside our QA engineer.
